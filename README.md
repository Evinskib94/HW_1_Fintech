# Got to Love Regtech 

## Overview and Origin





Creating an innovation to the world only begins with the mindset of an entrepreneur, from Steve Jobs to Jeff Bezos we see such impacts. These individuals open the door to a whole new world. The world at first is  maintained to a similar psychological response to  individuals whom have suffered a loss. The world first went through disbelief disregarding what both these pioneers have created, specifically criticizing the state of their mind. Next the world transition into a disorganization and dependence. As the theses systems were being used  around the world they transitioned there following group to gain the upper hand in the market. This caused the disorganization of firms that were not following  transitions triggering them to see a decrease in revenue and to become heavily dependent on their old ways. This leads to intellectualization, initiating  any outstanding firms to begin the process of accepting the change and following in the innovation of such systems. The concept of this can be correlated in all aspects of innovation especially the new and upcoming growth of fintech. Before moving forward you may ask “what is fintech?”. Fintech is the integration of the technological interface and the financial services of the world. There are many subdivisions of fintech such as: 
- Payments/Billing
- Capital Investment
- Investment Management
- Wealth Management
- Enterprise Solutions
- Insurance (InsurTech)
- Mortgage/Real Estate
- Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking
- Lending
- Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
- Regulation Technology (RegTech)
- Open Banking
- Robo-advising

The most involved from a governmental standpoint would be the RegTech. Regtech helps the businesses comply to certain regulation regarding the businesses structure. This provides the firm to hedge against the risk of a human making the errors. Since this innovation is still in the process of being accepted many firms are enjoying the new transition to deviate against risk. 

An award winning firm ,which is called Shield FC ,can be an example of making such improvements to the financial industry. Shield FC helps each financial institutions in the industry to manage and control communication data to meet regulatory requirements without impacting operational reporting. Shield FC is a private firm that is considered as a startup. The firm was incorporated in 2017. The firm in this new error vision that they would build with one goal in mind to forge the future of Autonomous Compliance. The founders Shirman Weitzman and  Ofri Shabtai initiated that idea with one thing in mind how to get the funding for such a cultivating task. The founders sought out investors who then helped maneuverer them self into the role. Due to the firm being a start up there is lack of information on how they are funded.






## Business Activities

The firm sees the potential of their business  to provide a solution to their  customers who are heavily involved  in complying to record keeping and compliance investigation. The firm attack their clients issues by using a platform they created called Enterprise -grade data management. This platform consist of four areas that helps the client become fully effective. The first thing the platform does is capture the electronic communications using a pre integrated connectors to all platforms. This will includes voice messaging mobile and data. This process helps the clients data supplement external data from sources. The Next section will be focused on the archive. The archive will record all data and encrypt each records into a formal archive. The platform then replicates the data into other centers for disaster recapture. After this is completed the platform conducts a multi analysis. It uses an advanced multi-layer analytics engine. The firm then  normalizes and analyses data to connect interactions throughout the transaction. It formerly begin reconstructing a complete communication chain designed to address compliance needs. Last the platform investigates. It provides the compliance department  to perform the investigation on the topic that is in scope. This eliminates the tedious work that firm typically would manually have to go into. For example a simple manual process of recovering a  document would have to be located into any file area, but this platform provided text research so it can pull the data effectively and quick. 

In regards to their competitors what makes this so effortless is the system having an extremely user friendly. The firm is an industry that is complex, now that it’s using a system to user that might not have the same knowledge, it requires it to be user friendly to have a high user satisfaction. 





## Landscape
The firms is in the domain Compliance Management Software. The compliance management software as stated before is a creation for hedge against risk of no compliance in the industry. Compliance software management software has seen great growth in the past decade due to innovations. The industry sees the opportunity to cut cost on hiring less in the compliance department due to the major innovations. The huge trend in the industry is to just simply comply without decreasing revenue and increasing  the business expense immensely. These new firms of Compliance Management Software are makeing these impacts such as :
- Actimize
- Smarsh
- Digital Reasoning Intensive





## Results
The firm has just entered the market and looks like their competitor aren’t going to see such a huge impact yet . The firm does  have the typical concept of receiving awards that all business in this industry use as being elite.  The firm maintains multiple alcalde which range from “Deloitte 1st choice in 2019 “ to “Best Financial Compliance Solution in 2019”. The result from this does not lead  to business impact  to the industry. Due to the firm only having 1million dollars of revenue this year. The data clarifies that the firm is still the in the early phases in the market. 



## Recommendations

Throughout this whole research of the Shield FC I  noticed the startup still in the process of incorporating R&D into the firm.  If the firm were to receive a bigger investor in this area I would say it would be best for the firm to begin on focusing on diversifying themselves into other market. The other markets may also need a system that can delegate the issue from the compliance investigation at hand. The firm should be using certain service like building a cryptocurrency compliance. The Crypto world is still fairly new compared to other markets that have been here for ages. The firm should approach it in a sense of “why not be the innovation at hand”. The firm would be capable of creating a blockchain that uses the codes from the transactions to maintain some sort of regulatory conception. The firm new innovation at hand would help them be a competitor not only one market but two and possibly the new trend in one.
